# Data set
This work uses an online retail data set obtained from the uci machine learning repository [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00352/). This transnational data set contains one year (between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011) sales transactions that occurred in 38 different countries for a UK-based and registered online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. The data set has 541,909 observations(each representing a product) and 8 features. Due to the size of the data set, itâ€™ll be difficult to understand if there is any relationship between these products. This necessitates the use of a data mining technique to help provide relationship between products and thus a business insight. The data set has the following features:
1) InvoiceNo: Invoice number. This is a 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation.
2) StockCode: Product (item) code. This is a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.
3) Description: Product (item). This is the product name.
4) Quantity: This represents the quantities of each product (item) per transaction.
5) InvoiceDate: Invice Date and time. This shows the day and time when each transaction was generated.
6) UnitPrice: Unit price. This is the Product price per unit in sterling.
7) CustomerID: Customer number. This is a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer.
8) Country: Country name. This shows the name of the country where each customer resides.
